        <p>Some glitch:
The Great Firewall is not just blocking the user from checking outside world, but also blocking the outside to check
what China really is.
And that&rsquo;s why a lot of foreigners deceased their passion on exploring the mainland. The majority voice has been
replaced by HK and TW.
Now in AI era, LLM can&rsquo;t learn from the majority voice for Chinese and which could broadcasting non-factual knowledge
and opinions. which could be toxical in some case.
therefore, building the dataset for China ecosystem is really important for especially open-source model training.</p>
<p>Apply scientific method on prompt engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis:</li>
<li>Experiment:</li>
<li>Observation:</li>
<li>Conclusion:
Especially for Observation for Agentic LLM, find inner connection between LLM own knowledge and embedded knowledge
database. Loop and reason.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identify-the-cause-of-hallucination">Identify the cause of hallucination:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Feed the contexts irrelevant to the query, check if the hallucination is related to the context.</li>
<li>Prompt is little too complex. and model is not powerful enough.</li>
<li>Smaller temperature, 0.1 for mixtral 8x7b, 0.5 for GPT-4o.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not always hallucination, <del>could related with temperature. Not so consistent for same prompt. Temperature is not
useful to constraint.</del></li>
<li>Answer is too long, it&rsquo;s not suppose/possible to cover all the details in the context. Could be optimized.</li>
<li>Prompt is little too complex. and model is not powerful enough.</li>
<li>How to add a camera API to Meraki resources is a bad query. Even GPT-4o failed with inaccurate answer. Could be
improved by rewritten.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">TODO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> A standard process for quickly rolling out new prompt evaluations</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Building a positive and negative dataset for evaluation, using GPT-4o to evaluate.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Add a hallucination check step after QA during inference? It&rsquo;s costly, and what&rsquo;s the next step?
<ul>
<li>Filtering the retrieval to eliminate hallucination instead of repeating.</li>
<li>A different prompt with more rigorous checks.</li>
</ul>
